# Bees App
The purpose of this application is to explore programming concepts such as TDD, encapsulation and inheritance.



## Tools and Technologies Used
- C#.Net Core 2.2
- NUnit

## In a future iteration, I would like to...
- Use an abstract parent class called 'Bee' instead of the interface IBee. This would allow me to encapsulate the `Health` property: currently it is set to `public` because an interface can only have public methods/properties.
- Create a UI that allows the user to click on the bees (tackle step two of this challenge).
